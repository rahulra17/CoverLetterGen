# 📝 Cover Letter Gen

**Welcome to Cover Letter Gen** — a project still under construction, but almost done.

This is an incredible tool that (if it works 😎) will:

- Take samples of your writing
- Learn your unique voice and tone
- Parse your resume and the job description
- Generate a tailored, voice-matching cover letter

All with the click of a few buttons.  
Say goodbye to boof-ass templates that AI resume reviewers throw in the trash.
